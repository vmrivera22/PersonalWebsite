**Projects**

> - [Lempel-Ziv File Compressor and Decompressor](/project/1)
>   - Designed and programmed a program that compresses and another that decompresses files in C.
>   - Compression program accepts any text, binary, or code file and outputs a compressed version.
>   - Optional specification of the output file and compression statistics, i.e., the percentage of file compression.
>   - Decompression program accepts files compressed by the compression program.
>   - Optional specification of output file and decompression stats, i.e., percent the file grew.
>   - Tested functionality and robustness using shell scripts.
>   - Created a Makefile to make compiling easier.
>   - Enhanced my understanding of C, data structures (trie), and automated testing.

> - [Web Proxy: HTTP to HTTPS](/project/2)
>   - Designed and programmed a multithreaded web proxy written in C++.
>   - Accepts HTTP requests from clients and converts them to HTTPS requests sent to the destination web server.
>   - HTTPS responses from the destination server are converted to HTTP and sent to the client.
>   - Connections to websites are restricted using ACL (text file) and managed by the proxy.
>   - ACL (text file) can be updated without restarting the proxy using interrupts (Ctrl + c).
>   - Multithreaded allows for multiple simultaneous client connections and requests.
>   - Client and server connections are managed by the proxy.
>   - Tested functionality to ensure quality and robustness using Python scripts.
>   - Improved TCP/IP and Network Fundamentals, C++ programming skills, and Python scripting skills.

> - [IPv6 Address Resolution Simulator](/project/4)
>   - Developed a terminal-based Python program simulating IPv6 address resolution on user-built topologies.
>   - Uses OOP and custom-made classes to create routers, switches, end devices, and the topology.
>   - Implemented using BFS search, simulating Neighbor Solicitation broadcast Neighbor Advertisement.
>   - Enhanced understanding of IPv6 and improved Python programming skills.

> - [Personal Website: Portfolio](/project/5)
>   - Developed a personal website using React, TypeScript, CSS, and HTML.
>   - Displays information about me and my education.
>   - About page displays information about my education, experiences, and interests.
>   - Resume page displays skills, education, and experience.
>   - Projects page displays the projects I have completed.
>   - Implemented a filter function that filters projects by categories. Categories can be "ANDed" or "ORed".
>   - Used libraries like:
>     - react-router-dom (6.21.0): routing within the web page
>     - react-markdown (9.0.1): render markup for pages with a lot of text.

> - [Smart Bike Lock](/project/9)
>   - Designed and built a GPS-enabled smart bike lock, interfacing with a smartphone app via WiFi and Bluetooth in a group of 7 people.
>   - Programmed GPS module, touch sensor module (for tampering detection), and Bluetooth server in the lock using Python.
>   - Helped manage the group members' work, set deadlines, and helped and picked up work other group members were struggling with improving leadership, dependability, and teamwork.
>   - Presented the project in different formats, including report document, PowerPoint presentation, and poster presentation, enhancing my communication and presentation skills.
