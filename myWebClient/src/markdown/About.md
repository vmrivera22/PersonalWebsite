**Education**

In 2023, I graduated from the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) with degrees in Computer Engineering and Bioengineering: Bioelectronics. During this period, I built a strong foundation in both fields, developing a deep understanding of topics like computer architecture, computer networks, programming, electrical engineering, and biology.

Currently, I have a deeper understanding of topics related to computer engineering, as it has been my primary focus in the last few years.

> As part of my studies I took courses like:
>
> - Data Structures and Algorithms
> - Computer Architecture
> - Embedded System Design
> - Principles of Computer System Design
> - Intro to Computer Networks
> - Advanced Computer Networks
> - Network Programming
> - Programing Abstractions Python
> - Logic Design
> - Signals and Systems
> - Applied Analog Electronics 1 / 2

Since I graduated, I have obtained a Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) certificate. This certificate required testing on networking protocols, security, and device configuration, showcasing my knowledge of computer networks. Additionally, I've familiarized myself with programs like Jenkins and Docker. Although I didn't enroll in a formal class to learn them, I believe I have a solid grasp of the basics of both.

Furthermore, after graduating, I have continued to refine my programming skills by taking on new projects and applying new knowledge to improve past ones.

**Related Interests and Hobbies**

As a passionate enthusiast of technology, I have always looked to learn about the latest advancements in the dynamic world of technological innovations. Whether tinkering with new gadgets or delving into a library's update, I am always fascinated by the potential life-changing technologies that unfold.

In addition to new technologies, I find enhancing skills in areas I'm already proficient extremely rewarding. Currently, I'm refining my knowledge of Web Development, focusing on React and the various available libraries to better the tools I have at my disposal for creating websites.

Beyond web development, I am also interested in expanding my understanding of general automation. The prospect of streamlining processes to improve my efficiency has always intrigued me. Automating a repetitive process would allow me more time to delve deeper into new topics and continue my learning journey.

**Projects**

Throughout my years of programming, I have developed several projects of varying difficulty and scale. This includes school assignments that I've dedicated time beyond the due date to improve and thus gain a deeper understanding of the topics. Additionally, I've developed personal projects, some for fun and others aimed at learning new tools. Regardless of the project, each has contributed to my development and expertise in programming.

> Among the larger projects I have completed are:
>
> - [Lempel-Ziv Compressor and Decompressor](/project/1): (C, Makefile, Shell Scripting, Data Structures)
> - [Web Proxy](/project/2): (C++, Makefile, Multithreading, Network Programming)
> - [IPv6 Address Resolution Simulator](/project/4): (Python, OOP, Network Programming)

**Hands on Experience**

During my time at UCSC, I completed network labs using both virtual and physical means. In my advanced networks class, I used CISCO Packet Tracer to create and configure a virtual network. These labs involved configuring various protocols and security measures, including multiarea OSPF, BGP, STP, DHCP, VLANS, Port Security, and DHCP Snooping.

Moreover, in the same class, I participated in additional off-campus labs organized by the Professor. During these sessions, I gained hands-on experience with physical routers and switches to design and configure networks. In these exercises, I configured OSPF, VLANs, Port Security, and DHCP Snooping.

**Work Experience**

Since graduating from high school, I've worked as an agricultural laborer at Sambado and Son during summer breaks to support my studies. In this role, I have undertaken various physical agricultural tasks, including piling brush, fertilizing trees by hand, pulling roots, laying tarps, hoeing, and driving and maintaining tractors, among other responsibilities. Although the work has been challenging, working there has taught me many valuable lessons.

Engaging in a variety of tasks regardless of weather conditions has fostered adaptability and a strong work ethic within me. I have also learned the importance of meeting expectations and goals in a timely manner. Moreover, during apple season, I assumed the responsibility of operating a tractor and helping oversee a crew of 15 workers, developing my skills in leadership and attention to detail.

**Unrelated Interests and Hobbies**

Other than programming and learning new technology, I enjoy watching and playing sports like soccer, basketball, and football. While I may not be an avid sports enthusiast, I take pleasure in keeping track of my teams' scores and watching games with my family. Occasionally, I will also play among friends or during large family gatherings.

Living in a rural area has also led me to pick up quad riding. Although I don't race, I enjoy "feeling the wind" and riding to take my mind off things.

More recently, I've taken up gardening and grafting. While I'm not an expert, I find fulfillment in my hard work, especially when it's time to harvest the planted fruits and vegetables.
