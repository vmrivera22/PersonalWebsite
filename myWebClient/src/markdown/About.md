**Education**

> I graduated from the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) with a degree in Computer Engineering and Bioengineering: bioelectronics in 2023. My focus during my time as an undergraduate was Computer Engineering, however, I have a solid understanding of the foundation of both majors.

> As part of my studies I took courses like:
>
> - Data Structures and Algorithms
> - Computer Architecture
> - Embedded System Design
> - Principles of Computer System Design
> - Intro to Computer Networks
> - Advanced Computer Networks
> - Network Programming
> - Programing Abstractions Python
> - Logic Design
> - Signals and Systems
> - Applied Analog Electronics 1 / 2

> Since graduating I have also obtained a Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) certificate. This required testing on networking protocols, security, and device configuration, further demonstarting my knowledge in topics related to computer networks.

**Related Interests and Hobbies**

> I am always looking to learn new things related to technology especially on topics related to software engineering and networks.

> Currently I refining my knowledge on Web Development, in particular React and different libraries avalable to better the tools I have available when creating a website.

> Along with web development, I am also interested in autimation in general as I find it interesting to streamline processes and find ways to impove my efficiency to allow me more time to further learn new topics.

**Projects**

> During my years of programming I have developed several different projects at various different levels of dificulty and sizes. Poject assignments from school which I have taken time past the due date to improve upon I get a better understanding of topics and personal projects that I make to learn a new tool or simply for fun.

> Among the larger projects I have completed are:
>
> - [Lempel-Ziv Compressor and Decompressor](/project/1): (C, Makefile, Shell Scripting, Data Structures)
> - [Web Proxy](/project/2): (C++, Makefile, Multithreading, Network Programming)
> - [IPv6 Address Resolution Simulator](/project/4): (Python, OOP, Network Programming)

**Hands on Experience**

> During my time at UCSC I was able to complete network labs using both virtual and physical means. In my advanced networks class we used CISCO packet tracer to create and configure a virtual network. During these labs we configured several different protocols and security measurs including: multiarea OSPF, BGP, STP, DHCP, VLANS, Port Security, and DHCP Snooping. Additionally, for this same class I attened additional off campus labs that the Professor held where I was able to use physical routers and switches to create and configure networks. During these sections I configured OSPF, VLANs, Port Security, and DHCP Snooping.

**Work Experience**

> Since graduating from highschool I have been working as an agricultural laboror at Sambado and Son during summer breaks to pay for my studies. There I have done several physical agricultural tasks including pileing brush, fertalizing trees by hand, pulling roots, laying tarp, hoeing, and driving and maintaining tractors (among other tasks). Although a lot of the work has been difficult at times, having worked there has taught me a lot of valueble life lessons. By completing a variaty of tasks regardless of weather conditions I have learned to become more adaptable and hardworking. This job has taught me the importance of meeting expectations and goals in a timely and efficent manner. Furthermore, during apple season, I would be in charge of operating a tractor and helped oversee a crew of 15 workers allowing me develop skills related to leadership and attention to detail.

**Unrelated Interests and Hobbies**

> Other than programming and learning new technology, I enjoy watching and playing sports like soccer, basketball, and football. Although I am by no means an avid watcher of the sports I do like keeping track of my teams scores and watching with my family at times. Occationally I will also play among friends or during large family gatherings.

> Living in a rural area has also lead me to pick up quad riding. Although I do not race I enjoy "feeling the wind" and riding to destress.

> Just recently I took up gardening and graphting. I am not an expert at this however, I took a liking to this as I feel rewarded for my hard work when its time to harvest the planted fruits and vegtables.
